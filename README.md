#Thank you for downloading SelfHare!

#In order to run the app, download the newest version of Unity.
#The default installation package works just fine.

#Then, download the entire code repository as a .zip file and extract the folder to an accessible directory.

#In the Unity Hub, select “Open”, then find the extracted directory and select it.
#The title of the directory will appear in the Unity Hub.

#Click on the title of the directory to open it. If Unity asks to select a different version,
#select the most recent—the version numbers are listed as the year followed by version numbers.
#If there are other pop-ups, just select the default option (if any) and/or “OK”.

#After this, the Unity editor will open.
#In the bottom left menu, navigate to Assets > Scenes > MainScene.
#Click the play button at the top of the screen to view the final scene.
#Interact with the UI as you wish, and click the play button again to exit the scene.
